; This is the values file (https://cosmosis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/parameter_files/values_ini.html)
; It defines the complete set of parameters for the sampler to varies over, and their limits.
; For TopHat priors, this value file also sets the prior window.
; Any Gaussian priors are set in the prior file, with the dummy limits defined here superseded. 

; DES and KiDS take different approaches to account for uncertainty 
; in their redshift distributions and shear calibration correction
; We use different parameters for each survey

;DES use Gaussian priors that are uncorrelated for between z-bins (see prior file)
