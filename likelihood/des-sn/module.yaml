-   FLRW metric and D_A, D_L relation

explanation: |
    This module gives a likelihood of the distance modulus of the DES Y5 supernovae.
    It marginalizes over the supernova absolute magnitude so there is no need
    to vary that parameter.

    The module starts from the angular diameter distance so it can apply the
    heliocentric correction, rather than reading the computed mu(z) values.
