assumptions:

    - "Data supplied in a specific file format"

explanation: |
    This module takes theoretical predictions for two-point functions calculated by
    the pipline and converts them into a measurement-like format. It interpolates
    the predictions at angular scales determined by the user and saves the 'measurements'
    to the general format used by the Dark Energy Survey, described here 
    (https://github.com/joezuntz/2point/).

    The user should specify which measurements to generate using the spectrum_sections
    option which is a list of section names of spectra calculated by the pipeline
    e.g. shear_cl or galaxy_shear_xi etc. 

    These will be saved to extensions of the same name in the output measurement
    file, or different names can be specified with the output_extensions option.

    All spectra will be saved with the same angular binning, specified either
    via theta_min, theta_max and n_theta for real-space measurements or
    ell_min, ell_max, n_ell for harmonic space measurements.

    angle_units: "string, default arcminutes for real-space measurements."
    spectrum_sections: "(multiple) strings, required. Sections of desired two-point functions in the datablock"
    output_extensions: "(multiple) strings, defaults to spectrum_sections. Names of extensions in the output file"
    theta_min: "double, optional. Minimum angular scale for real-space measurements in angle_units"

inputs:
    section:
        NOTE: "The name of both the section depends on the data type used from the file. It might be galaxy_cl or shear_cl, for example."
        ell: "If a Fourier-space measurement is used, the angular wave-number of the predicted theory curves."
        theta: "If a real-space measurement is used, the angle in radians of the predicted theory curves."
        bin_{i}_{j}: "For various i,j depending what is found in the file, the theory predictions for this value. For example, C_ell or xi(theta)"
