#This is a template for module description files
name: des-y6-bao
version: '1.0'
purpose: Compute the likelihood of DES Y6 BAO data

assumptions:
-   BAO chi2
-   FLRW metric and standard BAO size

explanation: |
    "This module gives a likelihood of the combination d_m / r_s from the DES Y6 data.
    It interpolates the ratio of that combination to a fiducial value, and then interpolates
    into a pre-computed chi2 as a function of that ratio.
