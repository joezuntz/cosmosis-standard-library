-   Galaxy bias constant with k and z

explanation: |
    "Galaxy bias relates the distribution of galaxies to the underlying (dark) matter
    field whose skeleton they trace.

    The matter power spectrum of galaxies is related to that of matter by a bias:

    P_gal(k,z) = b^2(k,z,...) P_m(k,z)

    where the most general bias is a function of wavenumber k, redshift z, galaxy type,
    and a whole host of other values.  Realistic bias models can be complicated; the purpose
    of this module is to act as a placeholder, usually when testing pipelines or forecasting.

    In this module, b is just a single constant number.  It generates the galaxy power and
    matter-galaxy cross-power from the non-linear power spectrum.

    Optionally, if it finds you have generated the matter-intrinsic alignment cross-power,
    it will calculate and save the galaxy-intrinsic cross power from it.
