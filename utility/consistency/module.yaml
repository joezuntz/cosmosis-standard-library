explanation: |
    There are various ways of parameterizing cosmologies with different advantages
    in different contexts.  This module takes a set of cosmological parameters and
    tries to use them to deduce the remaining parameters.  For example, if you specify
    ombh2 and h then it computes omega_b.  It has a fairly full set of relations to do this.

    If you specify inconsistent parameters (e.g. omega values that do not add up to 1)
    then an error status is returned.

    You can set an option to also calculate the Hubble parameter from the CosmoMC theta
    parameter, and vice versa.  This is off by default as it's a little slower.
    It uses the camb code directly so should match up.

    The standard set of relations is in consistency.py and relates the standard LCDM
    parameters, including massive neutrinos.

    It also converts log1e10As or A_s_1e9 to A_s, and (S_8, Omega_m) to (sigma_8, Omega_m).
