    CLASS is one of the standard cosmology codes for evolving perturbations
    in the primordial universe into CMB and other power spectra, as
    well as various other quantities. This is a very preliminary interface 
    to the general and powerful CLASS code. 

    See http://class-code.net for a fuller description and the github repository
    https://github.com/lesgourg/class_public for the latest public code.

    You should also check out the MontePython sampler code, which uses CLASS
    to do similar inference to CosmoSIS.


    This version of CLASS has been modified very slightly to be able to output at 
    more redshifts and to use the cosmosis build system.

    The CosmoSIS team packaged this module into cosmosis form so any issues
    running it here please ask us first.
