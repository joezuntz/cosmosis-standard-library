explanation: 
    py-SP(k) (Salcido et al. 2023) is a python package aimed at predicting the suppression of the 
    total matter power spectrum due to baryonic physics as a function of the baryon fraction of haloes and redshift.

    py-SP(k) is not restricted to a particular shape of the baryon fraction - halo mass relation. 
    In order to provide flexibility to the user, there are 4 different methods to provide py-SP(k) 
    with the required fb-Mhalo relation. 

    1. A power law with 3 parameters, fb_a, fb_pow, fb_pivot and an optional 4th parameter, m_pivot (default 1 M_odot)
    2. A redshift dependent power law with 3 parameters, alpha, beta, gamma (here m_pivot is fixed to 10^14 M_odot)
    3. A redshift dependent double power law with 5 parameters, epsilon, alpha, beta, gamma, m_pivot
    4. A non-parametric table of fb values as a function of redshift and halo mass

    A jupyter notebook with more detailed examples can be found within the pyspk repository at
    https://github.com/jemme07/pyspk/blob/main/examples/pySPk_Examples.ipynb

    WARNING - if the combination of parameters and your choice for the functional form of the 
    baryon fraction - halo mass relation goes outside the SP(k) fitting limits, pyspk returns NaN values.
    This can happen easily at high-z and high-k will return an error to cosmosis.  This SP(k) parameter combination will
    then be given a likelihood of zero, thus creating a theoretical prior that you should be aware of.


params:
    SO:
        meaning: The spherical overdensity, which must be 200 or 500. The halo mass then corresponds to the 
                 mass with a radius where the mean density is 200 or 500 times the critical density of the Universe.

                 The file BAHAMAS_fb_M200.csv provides this data from the BAHAMAS simulations (McCarthy et al. 2017).
                 If this is not provided one of the other three of methods will be used to determine the fb-Mhalo relationship
