    - "Flat sky approximation"
    - "GR is assumed in various ways"

explanation: |

    The Limber approximation integrates a 3D power spectrum over the radial
    direction to get a 2D angular power spectrum.  It is an approximation
    which is only valid on smaller scales.

    C_\ell =  A \int_0^{\chi_1} W_1(\chi) W_2(\chi) P(k=(l+0.5)/\chi, z(\chi)) / chi^2 d\chi

    The full integral must integrate over k(\ell) also.
    This module is a python interface to a Limber integrator written in C, and can 
    generate a range of different spectra depending on what options you set.

    It can generate spectra for any pair of
        (Shear, Position, Intrinsic, Magnification, Cmbkappa)
    though beware that for certain combinations and scales the Limber approximation will 
    be inaccurate.

    Depending which spectra you ask for, it will look for different input P(k) value:

        position-shear                    matter_galaxy_power               galaxy_shear_cl
        position-intrinsic                galaxy_intrinsic_power            galaxy_intrinsic_cl
        magnification-intrinsic           matter_intrinsic_power            magnification_intrinsic_cl
        magnification-shear               matter_power_nl                   magnification_shear_cl
        shear-cmbkappa                    matter_power_nl                   shear_cmbkappa_cl
        cmbkappa-cmbkappa                 matter_power_nl                   cmbkappa_cl
        intrinsic-cmbkappa                matter_intrinsic_power            intrinsic_cmbkappa_cl
        position-cmbkappa                 matter_galaxy_power               galaxy_cmbkappa_cl

    For each of the spectra listed above you can set a parameter in the parameter file 
    to describe whether that term should be calculated and what input n(z) and output
    names should be used for it.

    You can set either:
    shear-shear = T   ; to use the default wl_number_density n(z) section and save to default shear_cl
    shear-shear = euclid-ska  ; to cross-correlate n(z) from nz_euclid and nz_ska sections, and save to shear_cl
    shear-shear = red-red:shear_cl_red  ; to auto-correlate n(z) from the nz_red section and then save to shear_cl_red

    If no spectra are chosen at all then only "shear-shear=T" is assumed.

    The same forms can be used for all the other spectra, though note that the magnification spectra
    also require information on the luminosity function.


    Parts of this code and the underlying implementation of limber are based on cosmocalc:
